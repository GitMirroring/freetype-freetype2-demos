.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B ftgamma
displays patterns sensitive to gamma correction.  Slightly slanted lines are
rendered using grayscale or subpixel anti-aliasing.  In the grayscale case,
the correct gamma helps to achieve uniform perceived thickness of the lines.
The gamma value that corresponds to vanishing moiré pattern is ideal for
anti-aliased font rendering.  In the subpixel case, the correct gamma removes
color fringes that remain even after LCD filtering.

.PP
Alternatively, it displays series of gray stripes filled with solid color or
checkered pattern of pixels.  Your monitor's gamma value roughly corresponds
to the horizontal position where the solid and checkered stripes are equally
bright when seen from some distance.  Three brightness targets are explored:
33%, 50%, and 67%.  If the input-output curve of your monitor does not follow
ideal power law relationship, you might observe slightly different gamma
values at different brightness levels.  It is also possible to examine gamma
values for basic colors.
